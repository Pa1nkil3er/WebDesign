		<h1>What Is HTML? Hypertext Markup Language Basics Explained</h1>
	</header>
	<article>

		<p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>.It is a standard markup lanaguage for web page
			creation.
			It allows the creation and structure of sections,paragraphs, and links using HTML elements(the building blocks
			of
			a web page)
			such as tags and attributes.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Web development: </strong>Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page
				elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. </li>
			<li><strong>Internet navigation: </strong>Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and
				websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.</li>
			<li><strong>Web documentaion: </strong>HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to
				Microsoft Word.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>It's also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can't create dynamic
			functionality. It is now considered an official web standard.<a href="https://www.w3.org" target="_blank">The
				World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> maintains and
			develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.

			This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to
			<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript.
		</p>
		<h2>How Does HTML Work</h2>
		<img src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/html-historical-milestones.png"
			alt="html-history">
		<p>
			The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a
			contact page would all have separate HTML files.
		</p>
		<p>
			All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are
			the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an
			attribute describes the characteristics of an element.
		</p>
		The three main parts of an element are:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Opening tag</strong> – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped
				with opening and
				closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to create a paragraph.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Content</strong> – this is the output that other users see. </li>
			<li><strong>Closing tag</strong> – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element
				name. For
				example, <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> to end a paragraph. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<code class="line">&lt;p&gt;This is how you add a paragraph in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
		<p>
			Another critical part of an HTML element is its attribute, which has two sections – a name and attribute value.
			The name identifies the additional information that a user wants to add, while the attribute value gives
			further specifications.
		</p>>
		For example, a style element adding the color purple and the font-family verdana will look like this:
		</p>
		<code class="line">&lt;p style="<span class="blue">color:purple;font-family:verdana</span>"&gt;<span class="blue">This</span> is how you add a paragraph in HTML.&lt/p&gt;
		</code>
		<p>Another attribute, the HTML class, is most important for development and programming. The class attribute adds
			style information that can work on different elements with the same class value.
		</p>
		<p>For example, we will use the same style for a heading <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and a paragraph <code&lt;p&gt;>
				</code>. The style includes
				background color, text color, border, margin, and padding, under the class .important. To achieve the same
				style
				between <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, add class=”important” after each start tag:
		</p>
		<code>
<pre class="line">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
.important {
background-color: blue;
color: white;
border: 2px solid black;
margin: 2px;
padding: 2px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1 <span class="blue">class</span>="<span class="blue">important</span>"&gt;<span class="blue">This</span> is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt; <span class="blue">class</span>="<span class="blue">important</span>"><span class="blue">This</span> is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
	</code>
		<p>Most elements have an opening and a closing tag, but some elements do not need closing tags to work, such as
			empty elements. These elements do not use an end tag because they do not have content:
		</p>
		<code class="line">&lt;img src="/" alt="Image"&gt;</code>
		<p>
			This image tag has two attributes – an src attribute, the image path, and an alt attribute, the descriptive
			text. However, it does not have content nor an end tag.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, every HTML document must start with a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration to inform the web
			browser about the document type. With HTML5, the doctype HTML public declaration will be:
		</p>
		<code class="line">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
		<h2>Most Used HTML Tags and HTML Elements</h2>
		<p>Currently, there are 142 HTML tags available that allow for the <a
				href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/html-cheat-sheet " target="_blank">creation of various
				elements</a>.
			Even though
			modern browsers no longer support some of these tags, learning all the different elements available is still
			beneficial.</p>
		<p>This section will discuss the most-used HTML tags and two main elements – block-level elements and inline
			elements. </p>
		<h2>Block-Level Elements</h2>
		<p>A block-level element takes up the entire width of a page. It always starts a new line in the document. For
			example, a heading element will be in a separate line from a paragraph element.</p>
		<p>Every HTML page uses these three tags:
		<ul>
			<li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag is the root eleent than defines the whole HTML document</li>
			<li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag holds meta information such as the page's title and charset.</li>
			<li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag encloses all the content that appears on the page. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<code>
			<pre class="line">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt!-- META INFORMATION --;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- PAGE CONTENT --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
</pre>
		</code>
		<p>
			Other popular block-level tags include:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Heading tags</strong> – these range from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, where heading h1 is largest in
				size, getting
				smaller as they
				move up to h6. </li>
			<li><strong>Paragraph tags</strong> – are all enclosed by using the &lt;p&gt; tag.</li>
			<li><strong>List tags</strong> – have different variations. Use the &lt;ol&gt; tag for an ordered list, and use
				&lt;ul&gt; for
				an unordered
				list. Then, enclose individual list items using the &lt;li&gt; tag. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Inline Elements</h2>
		<p>
			An inline element formats the inner content of block-level elements, such as adding links and emphasized
			strings. Inline elements are most commonly used to format text without breaking the flow of the content.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, a &lt;strong&gt; tag would render an element in bold, whereas the &lt;em&gt; tag would show it in
			italics. Hyperlinks are also inline elements that use an &lt;a&gt; tag and an href attribute to indicate the
			link's destination:
		</p>
		<code class="line">
			&lt;a href="<span class="blue">https://example.com/</span>"&gt;Click me!&lt;/a&gt;
		</code>
		<h2>HTML Evolution – What Differs Between HTML and HTML5?</h2>
		<p>The first version of HTML consisted of 18 tags. Since then, each new version came with new tags and attributes
			added to the markup. The most significant upgrade of the language so far was the introduction of HTML5 in 2014.
		</p>
		<p>The main difference between <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/difference-between-html-and-html5"
				target="_blank">HTML and HTML5</a> is that HTML5 supports new kinds of form controls. HTML5 also
			introduced several semantic tags that clearly describe the content, such as
			&lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. </p>
		<h2>Pros and Cons of HTML</h2>
		<p>
			Just like any other computer language, HTML has its strengths and limitations. Here are the pros and cons of
			HTML:
		</p>
		<p>
			Pros:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Beginner-friendly</strong>. HTML has a clean and consistent markup, as well as a shallow learning
				curve.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Support</strong>. The language is widely used, with a lot of resources and a large community behind
				it.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Accessible</strong>. It is open-source and completely free. HTML runs natively in all web browsers.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Flexible</strong>. HTML is easily integrable with backend languages such as <a
					href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/php" target="_blank">PHP</a> and <a
					href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-node-js" target="_blank">Node.js</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Cons:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Static</strong>. The language is primarily used for static web pages. For dynamic functionality,
				you may need to use
				JavaScript or a back-end language such as PHP.</li>
			<li><strong>Separate HTML page</strong>. Users have to create individual web pages for HTML, even if the
				elements are the same.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Browser compatibility</strong>. Some browsers adopt new features slowly. Sometimes older browsers
				don’t always
				render newer tags.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>How Are HTML, CSS, and Javascript Related
		</h2>
		<p>TML is used to add text elements and create the structure of content. However, it is not enough to build a
			professional and fully responsive website. So, HTML needs the help of <a
				href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/css-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>
			and
			<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> to create the
			vast majority of website content.
